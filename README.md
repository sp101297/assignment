Credit Card Fraud Analysis using Machine learning models

The main objective of the Credit Card Fraud analysis is to predict the number of fradulant transactions taking place.


The steps involved in the project are:

1. exploring the dataset also visualizing as well as cleaning the data set .

2. Data preprocessing

3. building machine learning models

4. evaluating the models

5.tuning the parameters for better accuracy

6.upsampling- Upsampling (balanced): decide how many times the sample size of the minority class wants to be used and perform sampling with replacement in the minority class and sampling without replacement in the majority class.

7.final model creation and analysis outcome.



Final result of analysis:
The number of Fraud case obtained is 73 and accuracy score is 0.9974 (Isolation Forest algorithm)
The number of Fraud case obtained is 97 accuracy score is 0.9965 (Local outlier factor algorithm)
The number of Fraud case obtained is 8516 accuracy score is 0.7709 (SVM algorithm)
